# Custom-Visual-Ring-Chart-Dashboard

Created 1 Deneb custom visual- Ring Chart using Power BI to visualise percentage marriages by month for each State in Australia.
The chart shows the number marriages by month and Australian State encoded by size as rings, and (given that each state has a different total population) marriages by month proportional to the State encoded as a gradient background.

Deneb is a certified custom visual for Microsoft Power BI, which allows developers to use the declarative JSON syntax of the Vega or Vega-Lite languages to create their own data visualizations.
